# Passive Transparency Manifesto

**A paradigm shift in cybersecurity: radical openness as a defense strategy.**

This approach does not aim to shield an infrastructure, but to secure the individual.  
By systematically exposing all activity—publicly, transparently, and with precise timestamps—  
we significantly diminish the value and incentive of malicious actions.

Visibility becomes deterrence.  
Documentation becomes protection.  
Exposure becomes resilience.
